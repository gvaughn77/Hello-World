# Hello-World
I'm not sure if this will screw things up or not.. just trying to get a head start..

Hello All:

I'm taking a programming class for the second time now, so I'm just trying to stay ahead of class to prevent falling behind. The tutorial told me to make a comment to commit here so that is what I'm doing. (p.s. I find the term "commit" quite odd. It doesn't really roll off the tongue)
